# Objectives

- [x] Create Fiber Nodes to hold information.
    1. **FN** Ref to Incoming fibers
    2. **FN** Ref to Splitters
    3. Notes about splice case and container

- [x] Create links between Nodes with fiber information.
    1. # of Strands
    2. **FN** Ref to strand end locations
    4. Notes about fiber type, ie. PN or if armored

- [ ] Create individual Fiber strands
    1. **FN** In use / available
    2. **FN** Calculate signal strength on either end
    3. Notes of use, GPON, XGPON
    4. Notes about fiber characteristics (Size, SM/MM)

- [ ] Create database for fiber nodes, links, and strands
- [ ] Open database to resume consturction of fiber project
